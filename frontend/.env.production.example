# Frontend Production Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env.production and fill in the actual values

# ============================================================
# API Configuration
# ============================================================

# Backend API base URL
# Since frontend and backend are served from the same Cloud Run container,
# use a relative path for same-origin requests (avoids CORS issues)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api

# ============================================================
# Mock Service Worker Configuration
# ============================================================

# Enable Mock Service Worker (should be false in production)
# Set to true only for development/testing with mocked APIs
VITE_ENABLE_MSW=false

# ============================================================
# Logging Configuration
# ============================================================

# Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SILENT
# Recommended for production: WARN (only warnings and errors)
# This reduces console noise and improves performance
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=WARN

# Enable/disable API request/response logging
# Recommended for production: false
# Set to true only for debugging production issues
VITE_ENABLE_API_LOGGING=false

# ============================================================
# Notes for Production Deployment
# ============================================================
#
# 1. Never commit this file with actual values to Git
# 2. All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
#    (this is a Vite requirement for client-side access)
#
# 3. VITE_API_BASE_URL uses a relative path (/api)
#    - Frontend and backend are served from the same Cloud Run container
#    - This ensures same-origin requests and avoids CORS issues
#    - No need to specify the full Cloud Run URL
#
# 4. For GitHub Actions deployment:
#    - VITE_API_BASE_URL is set via Docker build argument
#    - No need to create .env.production file manually
#    - See backend/Dockerfile for build-time configuration
#
# 5. Production logging settings:
#    - VITE_LOG_LEVEL=WARN reduces console output
#    - VITE_ENABLE_API_LOGGING=false disables verbose API logs
#    - This improves performance and security (less info leakage)
#
# 6. VITE_ENABLE_MSW should ALWAYS be false in production
#    (Mock Service Worker should only be used in development)
#
